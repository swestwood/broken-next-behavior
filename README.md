# Example of bad behavior with random in useState

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Repro steps

- `npx create-next-app broken-demo --use-npm --ts`
- Add pages/broken.tsx
- npm run dev
- Load /broken 
- Hover over the link -- the linked Wikipedia page is different from the link text, even though it's the same variable.
- [Deployed version](https://bad-next-behavior.vercel.app/broken) where the animal in the link also happens to always stay the same, even whiel the rendered link animal is changing.
- ... that's it.
